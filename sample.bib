Then, through a couple of recent examples and a brief historical overview, it examines the power of data visualization. Following this, it explores the democratization of data visualization through four interconnected themes that provide new opportunities for political participation and civic engagement research: data storytelling, infographics, data physicalization, and the quantified self. The goal is to call attention to this space and encourage a larger community of researchers to explore the possibilities that data visualization can bring.}, booktitle={Electronic Government and the Information Systems Perspective}, publisher={Springer, Cham}, author={Bohman, Samuel}, year={2015}, month={Sep}, pages={302-315}}

At its core, our approach involves a shift in who analyzes data: from adult data scientists to young learners themselves. We first introduce the goals and design of the system and then demonstrate it by describing example projects that illustrate its functionality. Next, we show through a series of case studies how the system engages children in not only representing data and answering questions with data but also in self-reflection about their own learning and participation.}, note={arXiv: 1702.00112}, journal={arXiv:1702.00112 [cs]}, author={Dasgupta, Sayamindu and Hill, Benjamin Mako}, year={2017}, month={Jan}}

Although critiques of these new forms of data collection and analysis have grown increasingly loud, the voices of users, and particularly youth, have largely been absent. This paper explores the critical perspectives of youth who are programming with public data about their own learning and social interaction in the Scratch online community. Using a bottom-up approach based on ethnographic observation of discussions among these young users, we identify a series of themes in how these youth critique, question, and debate the implications of data analytics.

Despite a considerable body of work on visual variables, “physical variables” remain poorly understood. One of them is physical size. A difficulty for solid elements is that “size” is ambiguous - it can refer to either length/diameter, surface, or volume. Thus, it is unclear for designers of physicalizations how to effectively encode quantities in physical size. To investigate, we ran an experiment where participants estimated ratios between quantities represented by solid bars and spheres. Our results suggest that solid bars are compared based on their length, consistent with previous findings for 2D and 3D bars on flat media. But for spheres, participants’ estimates are rather proportional to their surface. Depending on the estimation method used, judgments are rather consistent across participants, thus the use of perceptually-optimized size scales seems possible. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of data physicalizations and the need for more empirical studies on physical variables.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics}, author={Jansen, Y. and Hornbæk, K.}, year={2016}, month={Jan}, pages={479-488}}

Floating objects can have different sizes and colours to represent extra information. Additionally, they can be levitated across other physical structures to improve depth perception.

The interactions were evaluated in a user study with 17 participants. Our findings identify the preferred methods of working with the data for each task i.e. directly tapping rows to hide bars, highlight the strengths and limitations of working with physical data, and discuss the challenges of integrating the proposed interactions together into a larger data exploration system.

As our attention for visual impulses and cognitive effort has become more competitive, new approaches are being pursued to convey information to people in memorable and intuitive ways. With human’s inherent proficiency in comprehending the physical affordances present in the real world, some researchers and designers are investigating how meaningful insights can be conveyed by way of “sculpting” data. This paper proposes a domain model to establish the concept of data sculpture as a data-based physical artifact, possessing both artistic and functional qualities, that aims to augment a nearby audience’s understanding of data insights and any socially relevant issues that underlie it. This paper also proposes a model of embodiment to capture and analyze the wide and multi-layered spectrum of existing data sculptures. In this model, the introduced concepts of metaphorical distances are used as a means to measure embodiment in data sculpture. The models provide groundwork for useful design principles for effective information communication of socially relevant, data-driven insights to a large, lay audience using data sculpture.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts}, publisher={ACM}, author={Zhao, Jack and Moere, Andrew Vande}, year={2008}, pages={343-350}, collection={DIMEA ’08}}
